<h2 align="left">Summary</h2>
Puerto Rico is a US territory and an archipelago in the Caribbean Sea consisting of the main
island, four small islands, and hundreds of cays and islets. The island 
territory is only 100 miles long and 35 miles wide. Christopher Columbus arrived in 
Puerto Rico in 1493 during his second voyage to the New World. Initially, Columbus christened 
the Island San Juan Bautista (St. John the Baptist). The name was soon changed to Puerto Rico,
or “rich port,” when the Spaniards realized the impressive amount of gold found in its rivers. The capital of Puerto 
Rico is San Juan and the population of the island is 3.1 million. 
Puerto Rico is largely composed of mountainous and hilly terrain, with nearly one-fourth
of the island covered by steep slopes. Puerto Rico has a tropical climate with little seasonal variation.
Both Spanish and English are official languages in Puerto Rico, which remains a predominantly Spanish-speaking 
society. The Island has almost 300 miles of coastline and nearly the same number of beaches. Puerto Rico 
has the largest shopping center in the Caribbean, Plaza Las Américas, and the most extensive rum factory globally, Casa Bacardí.

San Juan is the capital and most populous city in Puerto Rico. Founded in 1521 by Juan Ponce de León, 
who named it City of Puerto Rico (Rich Port). The capital of Puerto Rico is the oldest city under U.S. 
jurisdiction, but some people argue than St. Augustine, Florida, founded in 1565 is the oldest city in 
the continental United States.
